# What is a Number?

Like, if you look at the number "5", what information does it carry?

The value or symbol (5) is meaningless by itself, it must have a reference point, a "not-5". It means five steps from zero in the natural number line, so it implicitly carries an origin.

But now, what about the number 55? Both symbols are identical, but the first '5' means something different from the second '5'. Position in the sequence determines meaning, direction.

So, every number encodes necessarily three things:

- **Value** - Magnitude
- **Reference** - Relation to origin
- **Position** - Location in a directional sequence

Or else it's meaningless, and this ofc also applies to the number "1". Binary having just two states might be the biggest myth in computation.

Shannon treated the bit as primitive, two distinguishable states: 0 or 1. The framework simply assumes bits exist and builds from there, never examining what makes a bit possible, what structure allows discrete information to exist at all, it excludes the meaning problem.

A bit, like any number, necessarily encodes the same structure with 3 states. When you see "1", you're seeing simultaneously, implicitly:

- **Value**: The state (0 or 1)
- **Reference**: Relation to origin giving value meaning
- **Position**: Location in a causally ordered structure

This is how data becomes information. Raw values without reference and position are meaningless marks, information emerges when those values exist in structured relationships—meaning requires context. And this is exactly a vector structure; vectors carry magnitude (value), direction (causal structure), and position (location relative to origin). **The bit is exactly a vector.**

It's no wonder we can use bits to simulate anything, it's not about the 2 states, but the positional power that lets us encode anything. We can have infinite combinations of 0's and 1s, we can slice them and say A = 01000001 (65), B = 01000010 (66), and we can write all language. We have Gödel numbering, it becomes complete.

And no wonder we use vectors to encode literally anything—this is how LLMs work: word embeddings are vectors in high-dimensional semantic space, token processing is vector mathematics and attention mechanisms compute weighted combinations of vectors.

And then phase space is a vector space, fields are vector-valued functions, quantum states are vectors in Hilbert space, forces are vectors, gauge theories compute transformation of vectors, the entire mathematical structure of physics is vector mathematics.

So the same structure was separately discovered by computation and mathematics to describe reality, but why this structure?

## The Topology of a Bit

We must start from two self-evident, irreducible axioms:

### Axiom 1: Existence is Interaction

Russell's structural realism shows that nothing can self-define—all properties are relational. An electron's mass, charge, spin only mean something through interactions with other things. Mass is resistance to acceleration under force, charge is participation in electromagnetic interactions.

Properties emerge from relationships. If something exists but cannot interact with anything, it is ontologically indifferent from inexistence.

### Axiom 2: Coherence Requires Directionality

For any pattern to persist, time must flow forward. If future states could overwrite past states, no memory or persistence is possible. Coherence—the maintenance of pattern across time—requires the arrow of time as prerequisite. Without directionality, nothing can maintain itself, not even matter.

---

Existence seems to require, irreducibly:

**Coherence**: Quantum mechanics shows particles maintain coherent states—the wavefunction doesn't instantly randomize, patterns persist across time despite perturbation. Similarly, language requires a message to be coherent to hold information, like the sentence: "flowers elementary cheese penguin" literally makes no sense. For a bit to hold its value, coherence must be maintained.

**Interaction**: Russell's structural realism argues that all properties are relational—nothing exists in isolation, only in relationship to other things. For a bit to be distinguishable and readable, it must interact with its environment, information that cannot be detected is ontologically indistinguishable from inexistence. Similarly, even the basic properties of elementary particles are defined in relationships, mass depends on acceleration to be defined.

**Directionality**: Memory requires time's arrow: If causation could flow backward, if future could overwrite past, no states are able to persist at all, coherence can't maintain itself and interactions can't be verified. For bits to encode sequence, for computation to proceed step by step, time must flow in a single direction, thermodynamics provides this through entropy increase.

Each of these properties depends on each other's and are literally universally present in everything we can observe or interact. This is the minimum for existence, observation itself requires all three.

**Test it**: try to conceive of something that exists but lacks any one of these. Anything lacking coherence can't persist, anything lacking interaction is undetectable, anything lacking causality can't exist in time.

When these three aspects bootstrap together, identity emerges. The pattern becomes nameable, it gains "is-ness." Data becomes information, this is the minimum structure for discreteness.

---

### Bootstrapping from Continuity

We can also bootstrap minimally FROM continuity:

1. **Start with undifferentiated potential**: no structure, pattern or distinction. Pure potential. One.

2. First distinction emerges at phase transition, not caused by anything as causation doesn't exist yet. This creates a gradient, the first directionality—a difference that can propagate. Two from one perspective.

3. From directionality, now there are past and future states, coherence becomes possible. And coherent things can persist long enough to interact with each other, the persistence is detectable. From two to three.

4. And now a thing with identity emerges, that can persist and interact causally, everything that can be named follows: from subatomic particles to social structures. **From one to two to three to ten thousand things**, this intuition has been sitting with us for a long time.

Both the effectiveness of mathematics and physics using vectors to describe reality and our Turing machines that can compute any tasks using binary actually converge from this minimal structure that encodes reality: the atom of information. Before an excitation in a field becomes a particle, these three properties must be present to confirm it's signal, it's identity.

## Reality is Information

Landauer proved bits are physical. Erasing a bit dissipates energy, requires thermodynamic work. Information has mass-energy, it exists in spacetime, the bit is a physical phenomenon.

This creates a constraint: if information is physical, then information structure must obey physical laws. And if physical laws emerge from information structure, they must share the same topology.

**Why three?** A system with 2 states can only oscillate A → B → A → B, no branching paths, no complexity to emerge, a single binary entity. Now add a third state: A → B → C, but also:

- A → C → B
- A → B → A → C
- A → C → B → C

And so on...

Multiple histories become possible. The future state depends on the path taken, not just the current position. Three states is the minimum for unpredictability, the minimum for adaptive behavior.

But three states alone still collapse without temporal structure. Again: If future states can overwrite past states, if causality runs backward, the system loses memory of which path it took, coherence dissolves. The pattern needs directionality to persist—time must flow forward for the three states to maintain their relationships.

This gives us **3+1**: three states in one temporal direction. This is the minimum structure for persistent, adaptive, information-bearing systems.

### The Quark

But now, what is the topology of the smallest thing we can observe?

Let's look at a quark now, the thing protons and neutrons are made of, the foundation of all matter. A quark exists in one of three color charge states: red, green, or blue. Not really colors in the visual sense, these are labels for three distinct quantum states.

A quark must be in one of these three states. It has magnitude (mass, charge), position (spacetime location), and direction (color state in symmetry space).

Here's the constraint: quarks must combine to form color-neutral states, a proton contains three quarks—one red, one green, one blue, and together they form "white," a balanced state.

> **Note**: QCD's full structure is SU(3) gauge symmetry - eight gluons mediating interactions between three color states. But the minimum observable pattern is three colors that must balance, evolving in time.

Color confinement ENFORCES Russell's rule: cannot self-define, cannot isolate a quark. Pull a quark away from its partners and the strong force strengthens with distance, pull harder and the energy creates new quark-antiquark pairs from vacuum. You never get a lone quark.

Only color-neutral combinations can exist as observable particles, 2-color pairs are unstable and then 3-color pairs form protons and neutrons, our actual building blocks of matter.

## Space-time

If you're still following up until now, you must likely be thinking: this explains too much. And you're right to be skeptical, but every scientific revolution came from unification, celestial to terrestrial mechanics, then electricity and magnetism, and of course space and time, every time disparate phenomena collapsing into a single structure.

But the point here is not to try and praise this piece for the scope, instead, we should ask **why does nature seem to reuse the same solutions?** Once this structure exists at the quantum level, any higher-order information processing must use the same topology, so the bit and the vector and the physics were all discoveries, not inventions.

But bear with me for a few more so we can close this loop before self-reference gets us.

Bits encode directional change, measured by paying the Landauer's thermodynamic cost. Change is movement, and movement is exactly space AND time, you cannot define one without the other.

The 3+1 structure we derived appears clearly here, spacetime has three spatial dimensions plus one temporal dimension. But space and time are simply different signs of the same thing—we measure spatial intervals with (x², y², z²) and temporal intervals with (-c²t²). Same structure, opposite signature.

We observe space FROM time. Every measurement is relational—position means nothing without reference frame, velocity means nothing without comparison. That's why we call it general relativity: matter tells spacetime how to curve, spacetime tells matter how to move. Pure relationship, existence through interaction.

So far we have the same pattern appearing at the computational level, the logical level, the mathematical level, the quantum level and the spacetime level. It IS uncanny how we can define our biggest and smallest units (fundamental particles and blackholes) by basically the same properties, mass, spin and charge. Directional movement with magnitude.

Reality doesn't seem to contain information using this structure, it seems to BE information using this structure; we are describing ontology, not epistemology. But what about the middle stuff, what about the really complex stuff, what about life?

## The Game of Life

For anything to maintain persistence, it must establish a one directional information flow. Once directionality is established (our 2nd axiom), past states can be maintained, the system can learn and adapt, coherence doesn't show up automatically, it gets selected for iteratively.

And we observe this exact directionality in Biology's Central Dogma, information must flow from DNA to RNA to Protein, but never backwards, the directionality is enforced by survivability.

Mutations create history, evolution selects for patterns that maintain coherence. Then organisms that preserve information structure reproduce, and organisms that lose coherence die.

Life discovered computation. The cell reads genetic information, processes it through metabolic pathways, outputs proteins and behavior. The substrate is molecular, but the underlying structure is identical. Patterns that preserve coherence across time persist and outcompete patterns that break it, until they disappear.

Life is information maintaining itself, but once a system can preserve coherent patterns and interact, it can also transmit those patterns to other systems. The same structure that stores information also broadcasts information, to exist is to interact. Communication becomes possible.

---

## What is Language?

What do you need to actually encode and communicate information? Just a medium that can propagate a coherent state through space. Sound works perfectly for this.

Vocalizations carry across distance, and early animal communication was simple mappings, one sound just meant one thing happening (mating calls, territory marking, alarm calls). Each sound triggers a specific behavior, but there wasn't much of a point to repeating a sound.

But one thing makes humans very uniquely special: we really like rhythm. When you repeat a sound, you establish a pattern that persists across time. The repetition creates coherence, and once rhythm exists, you have directional flow again.

**What exactly is a note?** A sustained vocalization at a stable frequency, held across time in a rhythmic structure.

A note has:

- **Value**: Pitch/frequency (magnitude)
- **Reference**: Relation to other notes in the pattern (harmonic and rhythmic context)
- **Position**: Location in the temporal sequence (when it occurs in the pattern)

And life discovers computation again, same structure, changing substrates.

The first sustained notes became the first vowels, consonants emerged as breaks and boundaries between sustained patterns. Together they formed syllables—units that could be sequenced, combined, and reused.

The acoustic space became systematically explorable. Any pattern could be encoded, transmitted, and decoded, then finally writing comes along and well, the rest is literally history.

## Who are We?

We're left with one subject: humanity. After mathematics, computation, quantum mechanics, physics, biology, language—what about philosophy? What about the observer?

You can approach this two ways: empirically through psychology, or philosophically through metaphysics. Either way, one thing appears again. Every animal has a brain that processes information, but humans do something distinct: we maintain a persistent story about a self.

It's our final directional boundary, self vs other, subject vs object. We observe reality from our own directionality, our own sense of time. "I" am thinking, "I" am deciding, "I" exist continuously through time, we are directional flow observing directional flow. Computation finally discovers itself.

Identity becomes our fundamental measure, and the properties must be maintained to propagate at all scales. Systems move towards states that maximize coherence and away from states that threaten it. At our level of complexity, we might call it purpose, morality or meaning.

Form, function and purpose. Coherence, interaction and direction, same topology. As it dictates, there is no neutrality, valence is fundamental across scales, purpose is not something we project upon reality but something that emerges from information structure itself. Goals exist because patterns persist directionally, and value exists because some configurations maintain coherence across scales better than others.

**To exist is to interact directionally with purpose.**

## Conclusion

So a number is a bit is a vector is a quark is a note is a vowel and is us, and that should cover everything. From one to two to three to ten thousand things.
